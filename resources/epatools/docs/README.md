# GwEpaTools

**GwEpaTools** is a QGIS plugin that extends the capabilities of [Giswater](https://giswater.org), offering a range of powerful tools for enhancing the calibration and analysis of EPANET models.

## Analysis

For precise analysis, GwEpaTools provides the following tools:

- [**Additional Demand Check**](Additional-Demand-Check.md): Systematically adds demands to specific nodes within the EPANET model and then evaluates the network's capacity to deliver the desired demand and pressure. The assessment is done node by node individually and also by pairing additional demands within a maximum distance. By simulating these scenarios, users can gain insights into the network's performance and identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
