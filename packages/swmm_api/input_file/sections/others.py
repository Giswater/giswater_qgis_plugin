    Remarks:
        Transect geometry is described as shown below, assuming that one is looking in a downstream direction:

        The first line in this section must always be a NC line. After that, the NC line is only needed when a
        transect has
        different Manning’s n values than the previous one.

        The Manning’s n values on the NC line will supersede any roughness value entered for the conduit which uses the
        irregular cross-section.

        There should be one X1 line for each transect.
        Any number of GR lines may follow, and each GR line can have any number of Elevation-Station data pairs.
        (In HEC-2 the GR line is limited to 5 stations.)

        The station that defines the left overbank boundary on the X1 line must correspond to one of the station entries
        on the GR lines that follow. The same holds true for the right overbank boundary. If there is no match,
        a warning
        will be issued and the program will assume that no overbank area exists.

        The meander modifier is applied to all conduits that use this particular transect for their cross section.
        It assumes that the length supplied for these conduits is that of the longer main channel.
        SWMM will use the shorter overbank length in its calculations while increasing the main channel roughness to
        account
        for its longer length.

    Rules that control pump and regulator operation.

    Section:
        [CONTROLS]

    Purpose:
        Determines how pumps and regulators will be adjusted
        based on simulation time or conditions at specific nodes and links.

    Formats:
        Each control rule is a series of statements of the form:
        ::

            RULE    ruleID
            IF      condition_1
            AND     condition_2
            OR      condition_3

            ELSE    action_3
            AND     action_4
            Etc.
            PRIORITY value

    Remarks:
        `RuleID`: an ID label assigned to the rule.
        `condition_n`: a condition clause.
        `action_n`: an action clause.
        `value`: a priority value (e.g., a number from 1 to 5).

        A **condition clause** of a Control Rule has the following format:
            `Object Name Attribute Relation Value`

        where:
            - `Object`: is a category of object,
            - `Name`: is the object’s assigned ID name,
            - `Attribute`: is the name of an attribute or property of the object,
            - `Relation`: is a relational operator (=, <>, <, <=, >, >=), and
            - `Value`: is an attribute value.

        for example:
        ::

            NODE N23 DEPTH > 10
            PUMP P45 STATUS = OFF
            SIMULATION TIME = 12:45:00
            NODE  N23  DEPTH  >  10
            NODE  N23  DEPTH  >  NODE 25 DEPTH
            PUMP  P45  STATUS =  OFF
            LINK  P45  TIMEOPEN >= 6:30
            SIMULATION CLOCKTIME = 22:45:00

        TIMEOPEN is the duration a link has been in an OPEN or ON state or have its
        SETTING be greater than zero; TIMECLOSED is the duration it has remained in a
        CLOSED or OFF state or have its SETTING be zero.

        An **Action Clause** of a Control Rule has the following format:
            `Object Name Action = Value`
            `PUMP id STATUS = ON/OFF`
            `PUMP/ORIFICE/WEIR/OUTLET id SETTING = value`

        where:
            - `Object`: is a category of object,
            - `Name`: is the object’s assigned ID name,
            - `Action`: is the type of action
            - `Value`: is the action value/setting/status.

        where the meaning of SETTING depends on the object being controlled:
            - for Pumps it is a multiplier applied to the flow computed from the pump curve,
            - for Orifices it is the fractional amount that the orifice is fully open,
            - for Weirs it is the fractional amount of the original freeboard that exists (i.e., weir control is accomplished by moving the crest height up or down),
            - for Outlets it is a multiplier applied to the flow computed from the outlet's rating curve.

        Modulated controls are control rules that provide for a continuous degree of control
        applied to a pump or flow regulator as determined by the value of some controller
        variable, such as water depth at a node, or by time. The functional relation between
        the control setting and the controller variable is specified by using a control curve, a
        time series, or a PID controller. To model these types of controls, the value entry on
        the right-hand side of the action clause is replaced by the keyword CURVE,
        TIMESERIES, or PID and followed by the id name of the respective control curve or
        time series or by the gain, integral time (in minutes), and derivative time (in minutes)
        of a PID controller. For direct action control the gain is a positive number while for
        reverse action control it must be a negative number. By convention, the controller
        variable used in a control curve or PID control will always be the object and attribute
        named in the last condition clause of the rule. The value specified for this clause will
        be the setpoint used in a PID controller.


        for example:
        ::

            PUMP P67 STATUS = OFF
            ORIFICE O212 SETTING = 0.5
            WEIR W25 SETTING = CURVE C25
            ORIFICE ORI_23 SETTING = PID 0.1 0.1 0.0

        Only the RULE, IF and THEN portions of a rule are required; the other portions are optional.
        When mixing AND and OR clauses, the OR operator has higher precedence than AND, i.e., `IF A or B and C`
        is equivalent to `IF (A or B) and C.`
        If the interpretation was meant to be `IF A or (B and C)`
        then this can be expressed using two rules as in `IF A THEN ... IF B and C THEN ...`

        The PRIORITY value is used to determine which rule applies when two or more rules
        require that conflicting actions be taken on a link. A conflicting rule with a higher
        priority value has precedence over one with a lower value (e.g., PRIORITY 5
        outranks PRIORITY 1). A rule without a priority value always has a lower priority
        than one with a value. For two rules with the same priority value, the rule that
        appears first is given the higher priority.

            - ``P_BAR``-50X100: Parallel bar grate with bar spacing 17⁄8” on center and 3⁄8” diameter lateral rods spaced at 4” on center
            - ``P_BAR``-30: Parallel bar grate with 11⁄8” on center bar spacing
            - ``CURVED_VANE``: Curved vane grate with 31⁄4” longitudinal bar and 41⁄4” transverse bar spacing on center
            - ``TILT_BAR``-45: 45 degree tilt bar grate with 21⁄4” longitudinal bar and 4” transverse bar spacing on center
            - ``TILT_BAR``-30: 30 degree tilt bar grate with 31⁄4” and 4” on center longitudinal and lateral bar spacing respectively
            - ``RETICULINE``: "Honeycomb" pattern of lateral bars and longitudinal bearing bars
            - ``GENERIC``: A generic grate design.

        Only a GENERIC type grate requires that Aopen and Vsplash values be provided.
        The other standard grate types have predetermined values of these parameters.
        (Splash over velocity is the minimum velocity that will cause some water to shoot over the inlet thus
        reducing its capture efficiency).

        A CUSTOM inlet takes the name of either a Diversion curve or a Rating curve as its only
        parameter (see the [CURVES] section). Diversion curves are best suited for on-grade
        inlets and Rating curves for on-sag inlets.

    Assignment of inlets to street and channel conduits.

    Attributes:
        conduit (str): name of a street or open channel conduit containing the inlet.
        inlet (str): name of an inlet structure (from the [``INLETS``] section (:class:`Inlet`)) to use.
        node (str): name of the sewer node receiving flow captured by the inlet.
        num (int | optional): number of replicate inlets placed on each side of the street.
        clogged_pct (float | optional): degree to which inlet capacity is reduced due to clogging (%).
        flow_max (float | optional): maximum flow that the inlet can capture (flow units).
        height_gutter (float | optional): height of local gutter depression (in or mm).
        width_gutter (float | optional): width of local gutter depression (ft or m).
        placement (str | optional): One of ``AUTOMATIC``, ``ON_GRADE``, or ``ON_SAG`` (:attr:`InletUsage.PLACEMENTS`).

        PLACEMENTS: Enum-like for the attribute :attr:`InletUsage.placement` with following members -> {``AUTOMATIC`` | ``ON_GRADE`` | ``ON_SAG``}

    Remarks:
        Only conduits with a ``STREET`` cross section can be assigned a curb and gutter inlet while
        drop inlets can only be assigned to conduits with a ``RECT_OPEN`` or ``TRAPEZOIDAL`` cross
        section.

        Only the first three parameters are required. The default number of inlets is 1 (for each side
        of a two-sided street) while the remaining parameters have default values of 0.

        A :attr:`InletUsage.flow_max` value of 0 indicates that the inlet has no flow restriction.

        The local gutter depression applies only over the length of the inlet unlike the continuous
        depression for a ``STREET`` cross section which exists over the full curb length.

        The default inlet placement is AUTOMATIC, meaning that the program uses the network
        topography to determine whether an inlet operates on-grade or on-sag. On-grade means the
        inlet is located on a continuous grade. On-sag means the inlet is located at a sag or sump point
        where all adjacent conduits slope towards the inlet leaving no place for water to flow except
        into the inlet.

    Time series data referenced in other sections.

    Section:
        [TIMESERIES]

    Purpose:
        Describes how a quantity varies over time.

    Formats:
        ::

            Name ( Date ) Hour Value ...
            Name Time Value ...
            Name FILE Fname

    Remarks:
        There are two options for supplying the data for a time series:
            i.: directly within this input file section as described by the first two formats
            ii.: through an external data file named with the third format.

        When direct data entry is used, multiple date-time-value or time-value entries can
        appear on a line. If more than one line is needed, the table's name must be repeated
        as the first entry on subsequent lines.

        When an external file is used, each line in the file must use the same formats listed
        above, except that only one date-time-value (or time-value) entry is allowed per line.
        Any line that begins with a semicolon is considered a comment line and is ignored.
        Blank lines are not allowed.

        Note that there are two methods for describing the occurrence time of time series data:

        - as calendar date/time of day (which requires that at least one date, at the start of the series, be entered)
        - as elapsed hours since the start of the simulation.

        For the first method, dates need only be entered at points in time when a new day occurs.

    Unit hydrograph data used to construct RDII inflows.

    Section:
        [HYDROGRAPHS]

    Purpose:
        Specifies the shapes of the triangular unit hydrographs that determine the amount of
        rainfall-dependent infiltration/inflow (RDII) entering the drainage system.

    Formats:
        ::

            Name Raingage
            Name Month SHORT/MEDIUM/LONG R T K (Dmax Drec D0)

    Remarks:
        For each group of unit hydrographs, use one line to specify its rain gage followed by
        as many lines as are needed to define each unit hydrograph used by the group
        throughout the year. Three separate unit hydrographs, that represent the short-term,
        medium-term, and long-term RDII responses, can be defined for each month (or all
        months taken together). Months not listed are assumed to have no RDII.

        The response ratio (:attr:`Hydrograph.Parameters.response_ratio`, R) is the fraction of a unit of rainfall depth that becomes RDII.
        The sum of the ratios for a set of three hydrographs does not have to equal 1.0.

        The recession limb ratio (:attr:`Hydrograph.Parameters.recession_limb_ratio`,K) is the ratio of the duration of the hydrograph’s recession
        limb to the time to peak (:attr:`Hydrograph.Parameters.time_to_peak`,T) making the hydrograph time base equal to T*(1+K) hours.
        The area under each unit hydrograph is 1 inch (or mm).

        The optional initial abstraction parameters determine how much rainfall is lost at the
        start of a storm to interception and depression storage. If not supplied then the
        default is no initial abstraction.

        Each washoff function expresses its results in different units.

        For the Exponential function the runoff variable is expressed in catchment depth
        per unit of time (inches per hour or millimeters per hour), while for the Rating Curve
        function it is in whatever flow units were specified in the [``OPTIONS``] section (:class:`OptionSection`) of the
        input file (e.g., ``CFS``, ``CMS``, etc.).

        The buildup parameter in the Exponential function is the current total buildup over
        the subcatchment’s land use area in mass units. The units of C1 in the Exponential
        function are (in/hr)
        -C2 per hour (or (mm/hr) -C2 per hour). For the Rating Curve
        function, the units of ``C1`` depend on the flow units employed. For the EMC (event

    Groundwater aquifer parameters.

    Section:
        [AQUIFERS]

    Purpose:
        Supplies parameters for each unconfined groundwater aquifer in the study area.
        Aquifers consist of two zones – a lower saturated zone and an upper unsaturated
        zone with a moving boundary between the two.

    Remarks:
        Local values for :attr:`Aquifer.Ebot`, :attr:`Aquifer.Egw`, and :attr:`Aquifer.Umc` can be assigned to specific subcatchments in
        the [``GROUNDWATER``] section (:class:`Groundwater`) described below.

    Attributes:
        name (str): name assigned to aquifer.
        Por (float): soil porosity (volumetric fraction).
        WP (float): soil wilting point (volumetric fraction).

        Kslp (float): slope of the logarithm of hydraulic conductivity versus moisture deficit (i.e., porosity minus
            moisture content) curve (in/hr or mm/hr).
        Tslp (float): slope of soil tension versus moisture content curve (inches or mm).
        ETu (float): fraction of total evaporation available for evapotranspiration in the upper unsaturated zone.
        ETs (float): maximum depth into the lower saturated zone over which evapotranspiration can occur (ft or m).
        Seep (float): seepage rate from saturated zone to deep groundwater when water table is at ground surface (
            in/hr or mm/hr).
        Ebot (float): elevation of the bottom of the aquifer (ft or m).
        Egw (float): groundwater table elevation at start of simulation (ft or m).
