        The equation used to compute flow rate out of the underdrain per unit area of the LID (in in/hr or
        mm/hr) is q = C * (h - H_d) ^ n where q is outflow, h is height of stored water (inches or mm) and H d
        is the drain offset height. Note that the units of C depend on the unit system being used as well
        as the value assigned to n.

        The actual dimensions of an LID control are provided in the [LID_USAGE] section when it is
        placed in a particular subcatchment.

    Assignment of LID controls to subcatchments.

    Section:
        [LID_USAGE]

    Purpose:
        Deploys LID controls within specific subcatchment areas.

    Remarks:
        If :attr:`LIDUsage.route_to_pervious` is set to 1 and :attr:`LIDUsage.drain_to` set to some other outlet,
        then only the excess surface flow from the LID unit will be routed back to the subcatchment’s pervious
        area while the underdrain flow will be sent to :attr:`LIDUsage.drain_to`.

        More than one type of LID process can be deployed within a subcatchment as long
        as their total area does not exceed that of the subcatchment and the total percent
        impervious area treated does not exceed 100.

    Attributes:
        subcatchment (str): Name of the subcatchment using the LID process.
        lid (str): Name of an LID process defined in the [LID_CONTROLS] section.
        n_replicate (int): Number of replicate LID units deployed.
        area (float): Area of each replicate unit (ft^2 or m^2 ).
        width (float): Width of the outflow face of each identical LID unit (in ft or m). This
            parameter applies to roofs, pavement, trenches, and swales that use
            overland flow to convey surface runoff off of the unit. It can be set to 0 for
            other LID processes, such as bio-retention cells, rain gardens, and rain
            barrels that simply spill any excess captured runoff over their berms.
        saturation_init (float): For bio-retention cells, rain gardens, and green roofs this is the degree to
            which the unit's soil is initially filled with water (0 % saturation
            corresponds to the wilting point moisture content, 100 % saturation has
            the moisture content equal to the porosity). The storage zone beneath
            the soil zone of the cell is assumed to be completely dry. For other types
            of LIDs it corresponds to the degree to which their storage zone is
            initially filled with water
        impervious_portion (float): Percent of the impervious portion of the subcatchment’s non-LID area
            whose runoff is treated by the LID practice. (E.g., if rain barrels are used
            to capture roof runoff and roofs represent 60% of the impervious area,
            then the impervious area treated is 60%). If the LID unit treats only direct
            rainfall, such as with a green roof, then this value should be 0. If the LID
            takes up the entire subcatchment then this field is ignored.
        route_to_pervious (int): A value of 1 indicates that the surface and drain flow from the LID unit
            should be routed back onto the pervious area of the subcatchment that
            contains it. This would be a common choice to make for rain barrels,
            rooftop disconnection, and possibly green roofs. The default value is 0.
        fn_lid_report (str): Optional name of a file to which detailed time series results for the LID
            will be written. Enclose the name in double quotes if it contains spaces
            and include the full path if it is different than the SWMM input file path.
            Use ‘*’ if not applicable and an entry for DrainTo follows
        drain_to (str): Optional name of subcatchment or node that receives flow from the unit’s
            drain line, if different from the outlet of the subcatchment that the LID is
            placed in.
        from_pervious (float): optional percent of the pervious portion of the subcatchment’s non-LID area
            whose runoff is treated by the LID practice. The default value is 0.

    Examples:
        ::
